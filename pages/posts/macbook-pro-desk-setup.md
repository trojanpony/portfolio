I have been through many iterations of my desk setup. My current setup consists of my Macbook Pro, my 2018 iPad Pro 11", my 32" LG monitor with usb-c and my Logitech g915 keyboard and the g604 mouse.

## Macbook Pro

This is by far my favorite piece of modern technology I have ever put hands on. It is also the most expensive piece of technology I've ever owned. This 16" Macbook pro set me back $2500 when I bought it a year ago, and is worth every bit of that and more to me. It is absolutely incredible that this machine offers desktop level power in the form factor of a laptop, with a battery life that lasts all day. I literally never have to worry about charging this thing. I have literally used this for 8+ hrs of almost contineous usage and still had battery to spare. The screen is of course the Apple quality I have come to expect, and the speakers actually exceed what I thought was possible in laptop speakers.

## iPad pro 11"

I use my iPad pro (with Apple pen of course) more for studying and homework then I do my Macbook. I can count on one hand the number of actual programming projects I have had to do so far for my computer science degree. When I'm programming I use the Macbook, for everything else I use the iPad Pro. My model is the 2018 version which I bought refurbished several years ago. I honestly didn't use it very much until this last semester. I needed simplify my workflow so that I could just focus on learning the material, and the iPad and Apple Pen allow me to interact with the material in a more intuitive and intimate way then I can on a mouse and keyboard. The screen size lends itself nicely for consuming textbooks and other course material, while also being very comfertable and easy to hold for long periods of time. I recently purchased the chargen pro stand and I'm loving it even more. I thought I would use the iPad as a second screen for my macbook with sidecar, but I actually find that I prefer to keep my notes up on the iPad screen just as a regular iPad app and interact with it as I normally would using the pen and touch screen, rather then use my mouse and keyboard to drag applications over to the iPad. 

## LG monitor

I just recently bought this monitor, on sale it was one of the cheapest monitors I could find that had usb-c, and the ergo stand that comes with it is really nice. I feel like the stand alone is probably worth $80 and the whole thing cost me $200. I had been looking for a reasonably priced USB-C monitor because I want to keep the whole setup as simple as possible. So when I saw this go on sale I knew I wanted to pull the trigger on it. So far I am happy with it, but I haven't been using the monitor that long. I have my usb receivers for my mouse and keyboard plugged in to the back of the monitor, and my MacBook connects with a single cable which also provides up to 96 watts of power. It is the ideal setup for me rigth now. In the future I might get a laptop stand in order to use the built in screen side by side with the external monitor, but for now I'm actually enjoying the simplicity of window management with a single screen.

## Standing desk

This is the bekant standing desk from ikea. The worktop is a 4' section of butcher block that I cut out from a larger 8ft section. I use the other half for a second desk which I use for my gaming pc's. I love having a standing desk, it noticably improves my focus and mood to be able to stand while I work on the computer. A few months back I noticed that my focus and productivity was dramatically improved when I randomly decided to stand up and lean over the table while I worked. I was able to focus and got a lot done, and sense then I have found it beneficial to stand as much is comfertable while I work.

## My keyboard and mouse

When it comes to periphrials I am a logitech fan boy. I have head many different logitech keyboards and mice over the years, and I have always been happy with them. They are not always the cheapest, but the quality is always worth the price. For my keyboard I am using the Logitech g915 lightspeed tkl, and for my mouse I am using the logitech g604. Both work perfectly for what I need, and I have no complaints here.
