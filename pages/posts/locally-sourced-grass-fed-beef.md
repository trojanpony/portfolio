# Locally Sourced Grass Fed Beef - Greater Houston Area 

I just ordered groceries from HEB today, and a one lb package of 80/20 non grass fed beef was over $5. The inflation of food prices is seemingly converging with prices from small local farmers. The price per lb for a whole cow from my local source is $5.50 lb. Yes, that requires me to buy in bulk which comes with a pretty hefty upfront cost ($4400 for 800 lb of beef) but it is grass fed and includes steaks and more expensive parts of the cow. 

## Paying the deposit

I payed $1000 deposit for a whole cow. My man sent me some forms to fill out with my information with instructions to send payment with the forms via mail. Being the unmotivated person I am, I asked if he could take electronic payment. He sent me an invoice via Square and said to email the forms back to him. The forms are nothing special just a little contact information. The turnaround time for the order is 3-4 weeks. 

## Cuts
Here are the cuts listed on the cut sheet for a whole cow.
